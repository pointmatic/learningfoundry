# stories.md -- learningfoundry (python)

This document breaks the `learningfoundry` project into an ordered sequence of small, independently completable stories grouped into phases. Each story has a checklist of concrete tasks. Stories are organized by phase and reference modules defined in `tech-spec.md`.

Put **`vX.Y.Z` in the story title only when that story ships the package version bump** for that release. Doc-only or polish stories **omit the version from the title** (they share the release with the preceding code story, or use your project’s doc-release policy). **One semver bump per owning story** — extra tasks on the *same* story share that bump; see `project-essentials.md`. Semantic versioning applies to the package. Stories are marked with `[Planned]` initially and changed to `[Done]` when completed.

For a high-level concept (why), see [`concept.md`](concept.md). For requirements and behavior (what), see [`features.md`](features.md). For implementation details (how), see [`tech-spec.md`](tech-spec.md). For project-specific must-know facts, see [`project-essentials.md`](project-essentials.md) (`plan_phase` appends new facts per phase). For the workflow steps tailored to the current mode (cycle steps, approval gates, conventions), see [`docs/project-guide/go.md`](../project-guide/go.md) — re-read it whenever the mode changes or after context compaction.

## Version Cadence

Standard semantic versioning, with these conventions:

- **Every story belongs to a phase.** Bugfix stories included. No orphan stories.
- **Per-story bumping** (when a story owns its own release):
  - Bugfix or trivial change → **patch** (`vX.Y.Z+1`)
  - Feature or improvement → **minor** (`vX.Y+1.0`)
  - Breaking change → **major** (`vX+1.0.0`). Post-1.0 only, and only via the `plan_production_phase` mode, which negotiates with the developer about whether the breakage is substantively user-facing or technically-but-trivially breaking (example: a log-format change is technically breaking, but if logs aren't a core consumer capability, the developer may judge it minor or even patch).
- **Phase-bundling option:** a phase can run unversioned during work and ship a single release/tag at end-of-phase. Stories within the phase carry no version in their title; the phase's last story owns the bump (magnitude determined by the highest-impact change in the bundle).
- **No out-of-order implementation.** Story order in this file is the order of execution. If work order needs to change, **reorganize/renumber here first** — don't skip ahead and create version-number gaps.
- **Pre-1.0:** standard semver applies; version starts at `v0.1.0` (Story A.a).
- **Post-1.0:** every phase must go through `plan_production_phase` (the lighter `plan_phase` is pre-1.0 only). Major bumps only happen through that mode's negotiation step.

This is the authoritative cadence rule. **Do not extrapolate the bump magnitude from `pyproject.toml`'s current version** — re-read this section whenever you're about to assign a version to a story.

- **Cross-tab anti-clobber for the same `userId`.** Two tabs of the same browser, same user, can still last-writer-wins on the IDB blob — Web Locks `+` reload-on-write or BroadcastChannel-based leader election would solve it. Latent issue, distinct from this story; revisit when there's evidence of multi-tab learner workflows or sync work makes it forced. (Same scoping note as I.v.)
- **`AssessmentScore` shape + `assessment_scores` table reconciliation — capture in `project-essentials.md` once J.u lands.** Story J.u's investigation task picks between "add `(module_id, assessment_id)` columns to the existing `assessment_scores` table" and "introduce a separate `module_assessment_scores` table." Whichever path lands, the rationale and the why-not of the rejected alternative belong in [project-essentials.md](project-essentials.md) under "Domain Conventions" alongside the existing "Assessment scores — aggregate only in learningfoundry" entry. Deferred from the J sub-phase project-essentials sweep because the choice isn't concrete yet; capture it as part of J.u's wrap-up or a follow-up cleanup story rather than letting it slip.
- **lmentry integration** — Direct LLM invocation for content generation (currently done externally)
- **nbfoundry real integration** — Replace `NbfoundryStub` with Marimo notebook generation when nbfoundry is published
- **d3foundry real integration** — Replace `D3foundryStub` with D3.js visualization generation when d3foundry is published
- **Reset button** — Course / module / lesson progress reset; defined in sub-plan, deferred from I.j
- **Lesson-level `locked` override** — Per-lesson explicit lock/unlock field in `curriculum.yml`; module-level and sequential rules cover v1 cases
- **Locked lesson tooltip** — Explanation shown when a learner clicks a locked lesson item
- **Curriculum completion screen** — "Course Complete" celebration page reached after the last lesson's Finish
- **Non-YouTube video providers** — Vimeo, self-hosted; VideoBlock currently dispatches `videocomplete` via YouTube IFrame API or viewport fallback only
- **Progress export/import** — Sync or backup learner progress
- **`lessonresume` lifecycle event** — Revisits to lessons already at `complete`. Distinct from `lessonopen` (which fires on every mount including resumes) because it carries the additional invariant "previously completed." Useful for analytics on review behaviour. Deferred from FR-P15 / Story I.p — the data is derivable today from `(getLessonProgress before mount).status === 'complete'`, so the event is sugar rather than new capability.
- **Lifecycle timestamps** — `opened_at`, `engaged_at` columns symmetric with the existing `completed_at`. Deferred from FR-P15 with the explicit reasoning that adding one timestamp at a time yields asymmetric coverage; a coherent treatment covers all transitions, picks a retention/decimation policy, and integrates with whatever telemetry/export story is current at the time.
- **Spaced repetition / adaptive sequencing**
- **Multi-curriculum dashboard**
- **Advanced Testing Infrastructure** - See docs/specs/future-testing-infra-plan.md
- **`pnpm publish` OIDC trusted-publishing gap (upstream).** `pnpm publish` forwards `--provenance` (sigstore signing succeeds and is visible in workflow logs) but skips the GitHub-OIDC-token-for-npm-publish-token exchange — the actual `PUT` to the npm registry then 404s expecting a stored `NPM_TOKEN`. Workaround: drive the publish step with `npm publish` directly while keeping `pnpm` for install/build/validate (this is what quizazz's CI does — see quizazz Story M.f). Worth filing upstream against pnpm; no impact on learningfoundry today since we don't publish to npm. Revisit if learningfoundry ever ships an npm package, or if pnpm closes the gap.
- **Configurable curriculum-style templates.** Phase-J-deferred Feature 4 from [phase-j-pedagogical-authoring-plan.md](phase-j-pedagogical-authoring-plan.md). Different curriculum genres want different pedagogical commitments — a boot-camp curriculum might require every lesson to declare a duration and a role; a self-study curriculum might require nothing. Hard-coding required `meta` fields in `schema_v1.py` is wrong for both. A style template is a curriculum-level config (`curriculum.style: <name-or-path>`) that declares which `meta` fields are required, which `role` values are allowed, and which assessment positions are expected per role. Built-in styles to ship: `minimal` (no meta required, no assessment expectations) and `narrative-survey` (opinionated meta, three-quiz model expected). Validation runs as a layer after Pydantic schema validation. Deferred from Phase J because it depends on Features 1–3 having stabilized; revisit once two or more curricula have authored against the J.a/d/e shapes and the constraint vocabulary is empirically obvious.
- **TypeScript-from-Pydantic type generator.** Eliminate the hidden coupling between [schema_v1.py](../../src/learningfoundry/schema_v1.py) and `lib/types/index.ts` (and between provider return-dict shapes and their TS counterparts) by generating TS types from Pydantic models via `pydantic2ts` (or equivalent) and failing CI when the generated output is stale. Two-part scope: (a) generate from existing Pydantic models in `schema_v1.py`; (b) promote provider return shapes (`ExerciseContent`, `VisualizationContent`, `QuizManifest`) to Pydantic so they're generatable too. Best landed after Phase J ships its expanded meta + assessments schema so the generator covers the full surface from day one. Discriminated unions (content blocks, assessment positions) need explicit Pydantic discriminator config to round-trip cleanly.
- **Polymorphic `<AssessmentBlock>` provider dispatch.** `<AssessmentBlock>` is currently a direct wrapper around `<QuizBlock>` (post-J.m.5). When a second `AssessmentProvider` materializes (LLM interview, interactive game, etc.), the wrapper should select the concrete vendor component from `manifest.source` (or equivalent discriminator) instead of importing `<VendorQuizBlock>` directly. Deferred from J.m.6 (quizazz vendor-pushback § "Recommended change 2"): building one-branch dispatch logic pre-1.0 with one provider is speculative scaffolding. Documented as a forward note in `consumer-dependency-spec.md` RR-1b. Revisit when a second provider exists; the current direct-import design is forward-compatible with the change.
- **`<AssessmentBlock>` wrapper upward-re-emit refactor.** The wrapper currently persists internally via `progressRepo.saveAssessmentScore(...)` and fires a no-arg `onassessmentcomplete?.()` upward. Quizazz's vendor-pushback envisioned an alternative where the wrapper translates the event detail (`quizRef → assessmentRef`) and re-emits a typed `AssessmentCompleteEvent` payload `{assessmentRef, score, maxScore, questionCount}` upward, letting the consumer own persistence — symmetric with RR-1a's pure-translation-surface model on the Python side. Deferred from J.m.6 (quizazz vendor-pushback § "Recommended change 5" / RR-1b clause 2): pre-1.0 with one consumer, the inversion adds two footguns (silent score loss if a future consumer forgets to wire persistence; async-ordering for downstream UI dependent on a persisted score) with no current benefit. Documented as a forward note in `consumer-dependency-spec.md` RR-1b. Revisit when a second `<AssessmentBlock>` consumer materializes (preview route, authoring sandbox, alternate persistence backend); the current no-arg callback shape is forward-compatible with adding a typed parameter.
- **Sql.js wrapper library extraction.** Both learningfoundry and quizazz consume `sql.js`. The robustness patterns (HEAD-fetch precheck, typed `WasmAssetMissingError`, init memoization, repo-boundary swallow) are documented at [sql-js-wasm-robustness.md](sql-js-wasm-robustness.md). Deliberately *not* extracted into a `@pointmatic/sql-js-kit` package today: N=2 is the classic premature-abstraction trap, the genuinely shared surface is ~60 lines, and the partitioning / UI-surface decisions diverge sharply between the two consumers. Revisit when a third consumer appears, or when learningfoundry and quizazz independently grow mirroring features (schema versioning, multi-DB, sync). Patterns doc travels in the meantime.
